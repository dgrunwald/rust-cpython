# When set, do not call prepare_freethreaded_python() when calling
# GILGuard::acquire(). This effectively prevents the crate from automatically
# calling Py_Initialize() and other functions that attempt to automatically
# initialize the Python interpreter.
#
# This feature can be useful for programs embedding Python, which can guarantee
# Python interpreter initialization and don't need the automatic-by-default
# behavior or don't want the behavior coded into this crate.
#
# The feature may also be necessary if this crate's code executes as part of
# Python interpreter initialization, before the Py_Initialize() call completes.
# This scenario should be rare.
