# This is examined by ./build.rs to determine which python version 
# to try to bind to.
#
# According to PEP 404 there will never be a python 2.8, but maybe
# one day we could try to support < 2.7 ?
#
# Similarly functionality is duplicated in python3-sys/Cargo.toml 
# where supporting multiple 3.x's is more important.

# Use this feature when building an extension module.
# It tells the linker to keep the python symbols unresolved,
# so that the module can also be used with statically linked python interpreters.
